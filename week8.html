                   During this week, we had to start thinking for an idea for the final project.

         <h2><font color="#a19a59"><big> Developing an idea for the final project. </big></font></h2> 

              <p style="line-height:1.5">
                  
                 With the aim of being able to fully develop the project, we were given some guidelines that would make it much easier to find a good and structured idea.
                  
                </p>
            <p></p>
         
                <font size = 4, color="#a19a59"><b> STEP 1: Define possible interaction: </b></font>
            <p></p>
         
                <p style="line-height:1.5">
                  
                  
                    The first thing in which we had to think about, was the way in which we wanted our wearable to interact with the target audience. I thought that I wanted to be able to help the blind community, so in order to do that I thought that a device that could offer some tactile feedback would be the best option.

            <p></p>
         
                <font size = 4, color="#a19a59"><b> STEP 2: Define how the device would work: </b></font>
            <p></p>
         
                <p style="line-height:1.5">
                  
                  
        
                    After thinking a lot about what I wanted to do, I finally get to the conclusion that I wanted to make a device that <b>could read text and then display them in a panel that would change in order to give the sentence in braille code</b>. The first thing that I needed was a <i>camera or an scanner, that was able to read and process the words</i>With time, I think it would be interesting that this scanner could learn to recognise street signs when walking, text from a document when reading and this kind of stuff in order to make it really worthy to use. The second thing that I would like to create is a small display that you could attach to the opposite part of the hand palm. This would be a <i>motorised display that would have small sphere-end cylinders</i>hat would go up and down representing the different letters in braille code.

                <font size = 4, color="#a19a59"><b> STEP 3: Which parts of the body involve the user's function or disability how we could do it in the lab: </b></font>
            <p></p>
         
                <p style="line-height:1.5">
                  
                    The parts of the user involved in the project would probably be: the head, since the camera or scanner should be near the eyes area; and the hand, since it would be used to carry the device. Apart from that, the user would have to use the finger of the other hand in order to read the braille code shown in the display.

                <p></p>
         
                <p style="line-height:1.5">
                  
                    With this display blindness would for sure not be solved, but I think that I would be of great help for blind people, because it would help them to be less lost in life.
